# MAFW


MAFW: A Large-scale, Multi-modal, Compound Affective Database for Dynamic Facial Expression  Recognition in the Wild. The data source of MAFW is richer, not only from movies and TV dramas, but also includes short videos from reality shows, talk shows, news, variety shows, etc, which is closer to the real-world emotion.

### Features

- 10,045 video-audio clips.
- Each clip is annotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that describe the subjectsâ€™ affective behaviors in the clip.
- multiple modalities in the wild.
- 11 single-emotion categories and 32 multi-emotion categories.
